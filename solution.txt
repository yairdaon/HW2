Homework 2 solution - Yair Daon
-------------------------------

1. I found the bugs in 1,2,3,4 and 5. These are commented in the files.

2. I have the code running but was not able to figure out how to log 
into Stampede. Running on crunchy1 and crunchy3 using 16 processors
I don't see any clear pattern but scaling seems linear in the size of
the data. This is reasonable - I used a constant fraction of the data
as splitters(one tenth) and so communication costs should dominate 
the computaitional complexity inside each node.

3. We did not discuss this thoroughly but I would like to try to parallelize
some of the code I am using for my previous project. Mainly, I want to use 
stationary sample algorithm for optimizing expectations and this opens up the
door to at least two parallelizations. Firstly, we can do parallel MCMC (I saw
someone did that with Prof. Goodman's code a few years ago). Second, I can 
parallelize the optimization step by taking different starting points. I will
probably work alone.
